I am after a web site to post notes for myself. Practice writing in dutch. Post stories.
Why not a main stream setup?
Well, i have a few reasons.

{{% blocks/section %}}

- I do not believe websites owned by a few huge companies is the way to go forward.

- I want somethimg using little energy. low tech magazine solar website. This will need a blog post(s) to explain.
    
    - Such a set up is not provided by main stream 

    - This will be done gradually. If at all.

Why do anything?

- courage / confidence


- I have suffered my whole live with writing difficulties, communication issues and I want a public place to keep practicing and failing
