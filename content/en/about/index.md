About the website itself. 
This is a static web site. This means it uses very little energy to run. If you view a page it will be cached locally and not need to loaded again by you web browser. Saving more electricity. It looks okay doesn't it? 
Further anyone one us can do something similar. why would you do that? At the moment we give huge amounts of details and data away to a few big companies. They control most the internet. Variety disappears. Putting the internet into the hands of a few comapnies, is like putting all your eggs in one basket and creating monopolies. 

- I do NOT believe websites owned by a few huge companies is the way to go forward. 
 
- I want somethimg using little energy. An example is the low tech magazine solar website. https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-low-tech-website/ 
    
    - Such a set up is not provided by big companies. At the moment they encourage more and more resource use. Ireland has bet the house on big tech companies. The data warehouses in 2022 used 21% of their electricity. Higher than residential house holds (18%). To cut to the quick static websites use very very little energy compared to dynamic websites.

Why do anything?

- courage / confidence

- I have suffered my whole life with writing difficulties, communication issues and I want a public place to keep practicing and failing
