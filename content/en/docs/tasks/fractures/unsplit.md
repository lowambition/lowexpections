Tips 
- as soon as you can begin stretching your muscles. I fingered walked my arms up walls. It was hard reaching shoulder height. I lifted 500cl water bottles up to shoulder height. It felt like lifting 50kg. Physios visited me on second day and I checked if what I was doing was fine. They said yes. 
- find a physio who has experience. Try to avoid someone who follows a play book.
- If they do not respond to your legitimate issue and help the issue try find someone elsewhere
- Get walking, get exercising asap after surgeon says yes. Even before, ask what you can do. Muscles can fade fast. I was 50, fit and surprised by how much strength I lost.
- Diet, I would immediately gauge my diet for recommended dietary levels. Insure the fibre, mineral and vitamin levels are reached. Protein is a simple 1/1000 of your weight per day, some elderly need more, kids need more. The rest of us, I think not. Use an app.
- Read some info on recovery, I read the books on www.see.nf.
- Be Pro Active, and beyond.
- Make sure your bed is set up to help those caring for you. Hire a bed in if need be.  Also able to allow you to relax,
- Relax

Things I did
- I followed the call of my body.
- Did exercises that physio did not think was worth it, long walks around town. This led to a lot of neck movement. I got fresh air (snow/rain and sun), and felt real good.
- Remember exercise outdoors makes use happier.
- Talk to friends
 

Best advice
- New physio said: you will be better off with a very thin pillow or none. Try sleeping on the ground. With a very thin pillow my neck was turning as I slept. With a normal/orthopaedic pillow my neck was stiff on waking. Sleeping/camping on only a thermarest. It felt great. 

my mistakes
- not switching physio earlier.
- going back to work to soon.
- eating badly to start with
- having a couple of drinks(even with friends). Even the one or two I had interfered. From feeling bad for nagging wife for beer, feeling a bit blue as I sobered up. Plus, nutritionally not helping.

May 3rd 2023

I was training for a cycle ride. Around a 100km around la Roche in Ardennes.  Which was going well till the last 5 km. I decided to take the straight not busy road home. It had a speed bump in it. I just remember being concerned by it. It look like marble, steep and sharp. Been over worse. 

Whatever happened, I will never know. I woke up with a woman asking in French, am I okay. 
I was definitely not. I had had my lights knocked out. There was no real pain, just a flood of signals saying this is not good. I tried talking my crap French. We agreed I would not move. She has already called an ambulance. I started seeing what bits of me responded. 
Left leg good.
Right leg good, fingers, so on slowly up to neck. My back had not reacted well. Tensing muscles around my neck did not go well. I laid there thinking, this feels bad. My upper torso felt as if it had  been hit by a hammer. The lady said do not move. I agreed. Time reeled by. Someone suggested moving me out the middle of the road. Someone said my helmet was smashed to pieces. The lady said do not move him and tilted my head to one said. I was too busy feeling around my body. I could barely move my jaw. 

A helicopter whirred, shadows loomed over me. One hospital then another I am lying in a high care ward, multiple fractures to back, the complete fractures were no2 and no6. A couple of other were bad. My sternum, too was fractured. My neck was locked up in a brace. Not a big one. I could still move all limbs. I was lucky. High on morphine. I laid in bed and Prince Charles was crowned king, all in French. The French appeared to love the whole show. 

They fixed me up. It went good. Day after surgery I was tottering around. Coughing large chunks of blood balls up through a painful, tight chest but on my feet. The weeks worth of morphine had sent my imagination and dreams into overdrive and would take weeks fully fade from my system.  Recovery had just begun.



II

Recovery first 8 weeks.


I took the advice given, that not everything will be as before easily. It would have surprised me if it had been otherwise. 
I was told to lie and rest as much as possible for the first 6 weeks. We arranged for a hospital style bed to be set up in the house. This made for helping me easier for all. Carers came to help my wife once a day (could be twice if needed). I was in no state in wash myself. I had been given a neck brace I could not take off yet, unless lying down. I had also a full chest brace, on advice of the hospital. We had sought around for a physio, a local one was recommended. In retrospect I should have found someone with more experience. At the time, location, availability, experience of colleagues(2 years own experience), second place of work was main local ward dealing with cases like me, and recommendation seemed perfect. 
I followed the physios advice. Which in the first 6 weeks was a how do you do, lets take this carefully. I stayed in house, I walked backwards down the staircase. I kept my leg muscles working, I felt very lucky, I was fit before the exercise, in the first two weeks I had lost a lot of muscle. I wore my braces out of bed and often in bed.
Walking was strange. My injuries, led me to always want to fall forward, curl up forward. This neighing affected everything. Further, I turned and moved my upper body like a C-3PO in the original Star Wars.  
	Sitting and standing, I could do longer and longer periods. By month 3 in a supportive seat I could manage 2 hours sitting. In simple chair 30 minutes with no support. 


We checked in with a local surgeon who would perform the 8 week check to see if everything had heeled well. It was a perfunctory meeting, my questions not really answered. Such as, is there anything I can do? Is my on my back healing ok? I had not high exceptions, this surgeon was not responsible for the operation, had no buy in. I f find that in the Netherlands, the culture is such that if you are blow in, not part of the whole transaction, you are barely registered. Some folks are different, and I value those. This surgeon seemed to fall into the category of seeing me as a number. Tick a box and move on. 
The wound on my back did not heal smoothly, damp, fluid from it leaking, bright red. We checked in with the surgeon again, but he advised leaving it alone. It healed slow. 
The eight weeks ticked by slowly. The final check in and scans came. 
In principle all okay. One bone in the neck was slightly off, and I should expect never to be able to fully turn my head. The spine, I understood had not healed completely back. I should expect at some point the nuts that hold the two pins in my back in place to come loose. I should feel this I was explained. I received everything verbally. I found this curious. Dare they never to set anything down in words? Memory and verbally communication are liable to distortion. For me I was left with the feeling that the first 8 weeks could have gone better. I asked a few questions, about diet, what I could do. Again no firm answer. Likewise over what to ask from a physio. What I should look out for in the future. I found the professionalism of surgeon very low. Perhaps he could slice, dice and sew. Sadly I do not think operations are just about that, but the whole package. 
By now I had begun reading heavily around anything about recovery

I had given myself a target: run 5K after 6 months. 
After the last meeting the surgeon it dawned on me that I should have really looked carefully at my diet. 
I should have sought advise making sure I ate a really good diet. Take some nutritional advice. I had received no such advice.
I had begun reading modern books on nutrition, these stated that the outcomes from surgery are affected by what you eat before and after.  
My personal approach was to monitor in a broad sense what I ate. Gain a base line. 


My diet, it turned out, was not good. High fat, highish protein, low on minerals and vitamins. Arrrrg. I had been for years a flexitarian, meat only when other choice did not exist or socially the best thing. Cheese often, yet not enough calcium.
I went vegan. Then I panicked and bought all the stuff the health food shops sell. Waste of money. Some is useful as base for soups (powered kale), the protein packs a waste of money. I discovered we need little protein just under 1g per kilo of weight. If you are still in childhood, fall into certain conditions(say elderly) it can be good to go above this guideline. Going vegan and reasons why is  is another story. Its has been a great way to fill in the hours where I need a rest. Learning about what to eat for a balanced diet is endless.

I started running mid august. 200m. Every week 200m more, or as much as felt like. Just the block around the house. I admit, the route chosen was so I could give up. Or collapse. Or just run a bit further and walk home.
I also managed to get on a 26” wheel bike. Simply bending to the handlebars, sitting on the seat was difficult enough. I had decided I was not going anywhere near a racing bike. The bike I started with is no sit up and beg style bike, but a surly big dummy. Nice wide tyres. Steers straight and smooth. I had good breaks.
I barely could reach the brakes. I had to sit up straight, my back was not in the mood to bend. I couldn’t bend my neck. I could not turn well and watch out for things. This was another depressing thing. I had become a danger to myself on my bike. Once I had a sixth sense on a bike.
At least the bike allowed the journey to the swimming pool to swim. I had managed a few 10m stretches in the kiddies pool before I went on my own first time. The first time I went, I swam 25m. That was hard, very hard. Only breast stroke. I swam back to the shallow end and did all the stretches I could.  I felt tired when I was done ( another 8 more lengths) and the cycle ride back was tough.
At least sitting in my new high end office stool was working out. I could sit at the desk by mid august for 120 mins( year later I ask was this good or not I?) 

Running loosened up my back muscles. I felt better for it. The physio found tight, hard knots of muscle and massaged these muscles. I felt better for that too. My back had been a block, with a tight horrible node where the two pins in the back had been placed. This wound would just tell me to stop what I was doing. Just a dull pain. If I did not listen to it, I then felt pain. Lancing across my back. Further, my chest was tight, running was a game of trying to keep my breathing regular and waiting for the wound to act up.

There were downsides to physio. The loosening of the muscles made it hard to sit in my office chair. After a few weeks massage,  I could only sit the new office seat for 20 minutes.
I stiffened up all the time and physio undid it. Slowly but surely my neck cold bend more and more. Yet, I kept losing the gains. I had several sets of exercises and I did them. Standing, nod forward till I could not go further, and tilt my head back till I could not go further.  Turn my head left and turn right, tily my neck left, then right. Lie down on my back, pillow under my shoulders, turning my neck. Left to right.
I had a note book and noted down when I did any exercise. What I did. I ticked it all off. Many times a day. I kept on going, I had been told not everything may come back. I believed time would tell. Recovery would be slow. Keep on trucking was my thought. 

What my injury felt like 3 months after the injury. There was a large slab on my back that no longer felt like a part of my body. Think of a thick rubber mat glued to you back. I would lean against a wall to get a feel of its size. It had reduced in size, yet it as time wore on, I felt less and less change in size. There remained a big block on my back. My physio talked of nerves being cut during the operation. Meaning that some things may never come back. 

Begin November I did it, I ran the 5K. That was hard, and slow, I had always been able to run 5K in under 30 min, and mainly around 20 min. I did it though, I felt crap but I managed it. I staggered home and collapsed. In no mood to talk to my wife or indulge my son.

At the end of November my physio performed pretty heavy message, pushing my spine down straight. It felt pretty weird. I also began doing weights. 

On the second day I was out of bed walking after the op, I had begun with ‘weights’. It had been terrible to find 500cl mineral water bottles were very heavy. I lifted these bottles one by one from my waist to head height. I could lift my own weight before, 100 kg.  By November I was stronger but only lifting around 2kg to my shoulder from ground. The weight lifting replaced the messaging by the end of the month. I was not given an explanation. Other than messaging had reached its end. 
The weightlifting made me feel better. I could do more. It was needed. I shall not forget doing a bent over barbell row for the first. Earlier in the year with dumb bells I did 25kg per arm over and over again. Now, doing just one row with just the halter, with both arms it was hard, I failed to do ten, I stopped, recovered and tried again.

I kept on with the running, I kept up with the breast stroke swimming. By the 21st Dec I could do 3km in the pool in 50 ish minutes. By no means fast, yet I felt a champion. Even with a 60 something lady of large but short proportions streaming past me. I had tried the crawl, turning my head was hard. Breathing was hard. No more crawl up and down all the time. I could manage one length of crawl at okay pace.

I had begun to work again in September, building the hours up. While trying to pepper the day with my exercises and fitness regime. The modern world blessed me with being able to do work from home. By October I began travelling into work. Yet,
- I did not dare to do my exercises at work
- I sat for hours behind my desk, 
- The nagging dull pain of my back and stressing about work did not make life good.
- Taking breaks from PC did not happen.
- Commute to work, (55 minutes on stopper train), cramped, being anxious to find some place to sit for back support. Or lean up against a partition to hold my back straight.

This all added onto my own baseline mental issues, probably autistic/adhd, nervous as hell with some people. Tendency to be blunt, worry about all kinds of things, thinking I am useless all the time. Making jokes at wrong moments. Unable to say the things I wanted to say. Saying I’ll try and trying to please people. Not acting for my own good. I had walked away from computer programming 2 years before. Ostensibly to learn Dutch. I had entered the Building/ Renovation world. I mainly enjoyed the work, clear deadlines and targets, I was mainly on site doing simple labourer work or painting. All things I could do. I had gone back to programming three months before the accident. Two years not doing something does not leave you sharp. The accident only added another layer, I was not a confident person. 
Basically this is no recipe for success. Do not do it to yourself. Your body is number one, your confidence and skills no 2. Keep the physical recovery on track, or else you will store up trouble, stretch out your recovery time.

I had been asked by social services to go back to work. I said I would try. I give everything a go. Not afraid of failing. I built the hours up to what social services wanted. I gave it a go.

So, here I am in a hole. Time to get out of it. With the help of my wife and in-laws I found another physio.
I was told my contract at work would not be extended. I am someone that will tell people something is not a good idea. Sometimes that works, sometimes not. In this case I was accused of having poor English. Which I found laughable. I had written down what I needed to say, in Dutch. I had sounded out what needed to be said, with others before hand( In Ducth). Several thumbs up for clarity of question. I had then messaged my questions and yet a meeting went real weird. In the end they and then I resorted to english to communicate. I found the experience unearthly. I just sat there thinking this is a train wreck. This was a simple question. The people I had asked had got it, yet the guy who wrote the spec couldn't/ Nor had he read my written questions. Therefore, I had expected the contract extension chat not to go well. In any case, my contract not being extended was a gift. The tailwind I needed. I scaled back my hours, substituting in more exercise. I had already begun cutting back, trying to find a level where my body recovered. I was not. I had become a robot. Turning my whole body to look left/right and down/up. My back felt shit. I was getting depressed. I had not reclaimed my fitness in the pool after christmas. Running was harder than before. 

Sadly the social services even though I said I cannot meet the requirements cut there support completely. So, as usual a government service fails to support people. 
 
One good thing emerged, I began to lose weight.  
In the 12 days I was in hospital I lost 11 kilos. This weight, returned. The diet panic I had had seen me, over eat, buy extra protein drinks, and other remedies to pep myself up, like 250g bars of chocolate. I even added on an extra couple of kilos over my old weight.  
 I had switched to in principal to veganism back in October. Not quite feeling my way in the dark, more using a lodestone, than a GPS. But now, I doubled down. I had allowed milk chocolate. Also the stores on unhealthy food around the house were now running out.  Wholemeal pasta, black rice bulgar wheat were now coming to the fore. More berries, better berries, a handful of nuts a day. I had read more nutrition books and had tweaked and tweaked my diet. It will be long long fight but I will push my BMI down to something normal. I had historically performed highly with a BMI firmly in the overweight zone, 28-30. Even what I thought of as my in excellent fitness state, I had a BMI of 26, and I could easily run a 10k under 40 minutes or such things. Now, with new knowledge and perspectives it has to change. 

I need to give my body every chance of healing and recovery. To do that I see having a healthy body, a good diet as needed building blocks. Doing most exercises is easier when you are not carrying the extra pounds. I have lost so much muscle and am so stiff I need every little bit of help.
Just standing up, is easier when lighter. When your body aches and gnashes I decided every little helps. 
I saw a man around down in a green wheel chair. Wheeling himself along with two levers he moved back and forth on his wheel chair. He'd be on the main two way road into the town centre from the free parking. He;d be in the park. Rain, or sun. If he could I can.

New physio. Boy o boy, if I had started off with the new physio things may have been different. 
    • Sleeping arrangement changed. I now use a pillow that is a cm thick, and soft. Barely nothing but pillow case. Immediate success, woke up without stiff neck.
    • Massage of chest area. I could breathe properly at last. Running became more easy!
    • Message of back. New techniques applied. Wow. My back changed.
    1. The knot around incision for bolts in centre of my back has pretty well gone,
    2. The niggling pain of knot, pretty well gone, unless I over exercise
    3. The area of my back where I felt nothing reduced a lot.
    4. No feeling of carrying a big lump of wet felt on my back (unless I over exercise)
    5. I can turn my neck more!
    • I was a bit of a robot with my head/neck. Turning my whole body to look around. Think CP 30.  No more!
    • Turning my head to right even when messaged of old stopped before the left. At around half way of before accident. Now neck turns to right further than left
    • Pains in neck reduced.
    • Sleep occasional on floor, on a sleeping mat. That works! Feel better in back.

And a few more things. It could be explained away due to time for healing to occur, and improved diet. But I think its the physio.
Three months in with new physio, a year after the accident, I am a different person to 3 months ago. Far more active. Yes, when I do ¼ of what I used to do I need a rest, but I had been a power house. I can now lift 30 kilos, probably 40. It is a wonder.

I cannot say life is easy. 


IX.

So, 16 months in. No work, house dad. We decided I can try out seeing what I can do. I did DIY for my mother. That was not good and stiffened my whole back. Driving the car is now not hard and I can drive for hours if I exercise my neck.
