  A list of issues with Energy labels in the Netherlands. 2024
---


Trust! 

The the labels in the Netherlands are:

- Better than many other countries. More strict. For instance An Irish A would probably be a Dutch C across the board.
- The calculations are tested, the suppliers of the calculations need to jump through hoops.

Yet

- The survey is left wide open. There are lots and lots of small details which can change the value for a label. 
- These survey needs to take into account changes each year
- The surveyor is paid peanuts (300) to rush around around house filling it lots of details. 

What is to like:
The actual calculations.

What is not to like:
- You do not know how much energy the dwelling uses and what it will cost to run. 
- If its comfortable to live in. 

Example 1.
 
- Think of a 3 to 4 bed house, 150m2  with 10Kw solar panels or more. Far more than needed for the energy use of the house**
Some have 20,30, 40 kW solar energy supply. 

	<p> Such a set up can improve the energy label of a house dramatically. C to A. </p> 
	<p> That energy lable shift solves as if, by some miracle, the heating needed in winter is solved for the C rated house in winter***. I want to see a label that means, your house will be comfortable to live in all year round. </p> 
	<p> Acording to common sense, the higher rated the label the cheaper it is to run and more comfortable (climate wise) year round.</p> 
	<p> This is not true at the moment, you can buy an A++ rated house and discover it produces a lot of solar energy, but has high energy bills. The Energy part of name Enery label has been removed. Thus its just a legally required 'label' with a weak link to energy.
	</p> 

	<p> Lets dig deeper. </p> 
	<p> Think of this. A house will need 'X' kiloWatts to heat it, you use 'Y' kiloWatts to live in it (showers, cooking, electricity).  X and Y can differ greatly from house to house with the same label. </p> 
	<p> The energy heating a house is a 'Known'. If a house is surveyed well, you can make a pretty good estimate of how much energy it will take to keep it warm or cool. Decades of research underpin this knoweldge and it can be done cheaply. Yet there is nothing done in the building regulations(omgevings wet) to insure this. The reason being, you need to test how much air is leaking from the house. Thats not done. Further, how the insulation was done makes a big difference. The rules tighten each year, but the with no measurements of air tightness and the insulation value (lambda) the label will not be useful to those looking for 'good' housing. </p> 


Example 2.
(using example 1)

- The energy label does not measure all energy. 
	<p> The Y part, how much you use to live in it. It has to be added into the energy label because the energy used for it will produce heat that will keep your house toasty in winter. Thing is we are not all the same. Some dwellings may see 5 showers a day. A laundry room not in the garage, thus the heat released not heating the house up. Or 5 computers running, an old electric oven that is super inefficient. Or you cook all day with kitchen extract fan on. These things can change the energy use madly. </p>
	<p>So how can you give a label to that. Best guesses are used for Y. For X the building regulations and building standards of the time are used. In a true energy label the energy in Y can be used to reduce the amount of X needed. The current system does not handle this well</p>

<p> So, you see that label, you think a house is worth paying 10000 euros extra per lable value higher the house is? Think again, ask someone that has knowledge to help you out. They will charge maybe a 1000. Far more than the person creating the label but it could save a lot of money. You may be negoiating for a house thats on paper A++  but really a B. Thats a 30,000 euro price difference. If the housing market gives you time, get the airtightness test, dig into the house. The information can be used again, when selling it, or if you wish to do it up. Or see if the house has another label. If the house has a passivehouse(PassiveHaus) label, it will be repesentative. You will have a good idea of energy costs due to the Passive house label. </p>

<p>
Energy is the game. A country should try to not be too dependent on outside factors for energy. For energy to keep Buildings warm or cool in the Netherlands the ultimate goal would be a warmtenet, for hot and cold. Where all buildings are connected to it, exchanging for cold and/or warmth into/out of the system. The Danes realized this 25+ years ago and tried to tell everyone. Sadly in NL we have expensive warmtenets without the cold pipes...Mainly designed and built in last 20 years....

** unless thats to cover recharging a car, thats likely not there at peak energy prodction from panels.
*** its possible to have so much solar that you solve yourr winter energy demand.
