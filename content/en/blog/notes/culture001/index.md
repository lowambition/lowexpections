**This is a part of a series.**


I am guessing I am not alone in this, I have through the years listened to various comments about the English.

Such as the class system. How divided and sitting in the past the Uk is.

This makes me chuckle.

## Class, snobs and language

I think the Uk has snobs. You can bribe folks with a lordship, if this was not a carrot there would not be such a demand for them (there is, for whats its worth). Its all part of being connected, having a great image. In the know. This is what I see and read.
I have not seen 'class' in action, what I have seen is wealth in action. In the UK.

I see that too in the Netherlands. Though, I found the key factor is how you speak. Do you speak well or not. 

Its laughable that I have heard far more dismissivness of accent and how you talk in the Netherlands than in the UK. Even from those criticising the country I come from.

Don't get me wrong, I should post about accent divide/snobs in the UK, it definently exists. I love the accents of the UK. I feel its sad that many have faded away. Where I came from the accent was partially willed away by those growing up around it. They didn't want to be associated with some back country locals twang. Hah, i think. Most of South east england now has a version of Estuary or Thames valley english. Pretty boring to listen to. Unless you catch some kids prattling who have mixed, Yardy, punjabi and english. The accent and words you use make little difference if you can communicate.

It has hit me hard that many Dutch use language skills as a yard stick for intelligence. They do that to me with english. I have had numerous arguments over usage. My message didn't come across. I'd cite the online urban dictionary for usage, or manage to get a free snippet out the OED(those I argue with do not know what the OED is, meriam webster is getting better). Hammer it home. Yet, I am pushed back, if its not following the rules, its wrong. I am left wondering about their intelligence. Can you be so blind, to use ability to follow the rules of a language as a yard stick?

I dread to think what they'd say about someone Irish, using hibernean - english full tilt. That can be Liquid gold, words waxing lyrical painting fanatastic landscapes. Diverting and breaking the (englishmans) brain as he tries to comprehend, what 'bring it away with ye'  means. Some of the best authors use it. Best sellers.

Rules, and the english language. I have a message to the dutch, who wish to fight it out, there is no standard in English. Oh there is grammar, but no standardising body. Its a living language. India, the US, Australia, countless other places going there own way. Luckily at the moment the feedback loops between versions is big and they feed on one another.

The Dutch version of class, is how you speak. Immigrant beware!

Accents, variations in speaking style, they lead to wonderful innovation in language. Pushing one accent/manner of using words onto all, Dutch ANB/Standaard Nederlands style, just destroys diversity, and that is a weakness.

Please note, I simply do not see my typos, I re-read and fix it later. It sounded correct? Please contact me.
