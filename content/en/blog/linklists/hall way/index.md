**This is a part of a series.**
<p> Welcome. Come on in. This is a quick intro the links I have. 


## Links as an about me

<p> I have tried link tree. Yet another  listing systems. Seems better than most. Looks better than facebook. Tried Facebook, kicked off for not using my D.o.b and in general obstufacating my details. Its free, which is a big boon, that makes me ask why. </p>
<p> To look at anything on it, you have to login, and allow all cookies for it to work. Not my cuppa.</p>
<p>There is no privacy. </p> 
<p> Google, or the great data octupus. If the search engine worked as good as it did in 2000 I would not begrudge their tentacles. Sadly search engines are nearly all crap. Try find details that are not often updated. Small sites, densely written sites. No hope. The benefit is that no one will find my ramblings. </p>
